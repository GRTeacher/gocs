## 2. Summary
*A brief (roughly 5-10 lines) summary of this proposed GOC*

<br>

## 3. Motivation
*Why are you proposing this change? How will its adoption benefit the Graph AdvocatesDAO operations or community? What problem does it solve?*

<br>

## 4. Prior Art
*(Optional) Many ideas are influenced by prior work completed, either within the DAO community or other web3 protocols. This section provides the opportunity to recognize prior art that has inspired or influenced the design of the proposed code. What solutions have been explored previously in this problem space? What prior art inspired or influenced this design?*

<br>

## 5. Specification
*Describe your specific solution beginning at a high level and subsequently work your way down to lower levels. Include diagrams, process flows, organizational charts, and any other artifacts helpful in showing how your proposed code works. This type of information is required for a proposal to reach the Proposal stage.*

*Specifying the right level of detail is key. Too broad of a specification may leave readers with numerous questions where stakeholders might end up with differing interpretations of the core spirit of the proposed code. Defining too much detail may lengthen a code unnecessarily and prohibit a degree of flexibility required for future code owners to identify best paths to implement the code. GOCs are not meant to be detailed Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs).*
